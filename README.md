## Overview

This project simulates Rayleigh-Bénard convection using a numerical approach. The simulation models the temperature, velocity, and pressure fields over time.

## Features

- **Numerical Simulation**: Simulates Rayleigh-Bénard convection using a grid-based approach.
- **Data Storage**: Saves simulation data in HDF5 format for further analysis.
- **Visualization**: Generates PNG images of the temperature field at each simulation step, stored in the `rb_data_numerical` directory.

## Initial and Boundary Conditions

- **Initial Conditions**: 
  - The temperature field is initialized with a linear gradient from 1.0 at the bottom wall to 0.0 at the top wall, with a small random perturbation added.
  - The velocity fields (u and v) are initialized to zero.

- **Boundary Conditions**:
  - Temperature: Fixed at 1.0 on the bottom wall and 0.0 on the top wall.
  - Velocity: Periodic boundary conditions are applied on the left and right sides.

## Simulation Steps

1. **Pressure Poisson Equation**: Solved using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to update the pressure field.
2. **Velocity Update**: The velocity fields (u and v) are updated using the Adams-Bashforth time integration scheme.
3. **Temperature Update**: The temperature field is updated using the same Adams-Bashforth scheme, considering diffusion and advection terms.
4. **Boundary Conditions Enforcement**: The temperature and velocity fields are adjusted to maintain the specified boundary conditions.

## Usage

To run the simulation and generate data:

1. Ensure you have the required Python packages installed:
   - `numpy`
   - `scipy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `h5py`

2. Run the simulation script:
   ```bash
   python rb_simulation.py
   ```

3. The simulation data and images will be saved in the `rb_data_numerical` directory.

## Directory Structure

- `rb_data_numerical/`: Contains the HDF5 files and PNG images generated by the simulation.
