## Overview

This project simulates Rayleigh-Bénard convection using a numerical approach. The simulation models the temperature, velocity, and pressure fields over time.

## Features

- **Numerical Simulation**: Simulates Rayleigh-Bénard convection using a grid-based approach.
- **Data Storage**: Saves simulation data in HDF5 format for further analysis.
- **Visualization**: Generates PNG images of the temperature field at each simulation step, stored in the `rb_data_numerical` directory.

## Usage

To run the simulation and generate data:

1. Ensure you have the required Python packages installed:
   - `numpy`
   - `scipy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `h5py`

2. Run the simulation script:
   ```bash
   python rb_simulation.py
   ```

3. The simulation data and images will be saved in the `rb_data_numerical` directory.

## Directory Structure

- `rb_data_numerical/`: Contains the HDF5 files and PNG images generated by the simulation.
